p_type,string,"General categorization of facility from the EPA's RE-Powering Matrix (""Matrix dataset"")
greenfield - Greenfield facilities encompass the remainder of LSPV facilities that do not fall into one of the other named categories. Greenfield sites represent the majority of LSPV facilities and occupy land that may have previously been wildland, urbanized, cultivated, or reclaimed. Populated from EPA's Repowering Matrix (LINK please) and producer adjusted as described
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) - sites are a specific category of commercial, industrial and federal facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes and that require cleanup under the RCRA Hazardous Waste Corrective Action Program. Taken directly from the Matrix dataset
superfund - Superfund sites are inactive or abandoned contaminated facilities or locations where there is an active release or threatened release into the environment of hazardous substances that have been dumped, discharged, emitted or otherwise improperly managed. These sites may include manufacturing and industrial facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites, among others. Taken directly from the Matrix dataset
AML - Abandoned Mine Land sites include abandoned hardrock mines and mineral processing sites listed in the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) at this time. Taken directly from the Matrix dataset
landfill - These sites have been designated as landfills in EPA's RE-Powering Matrix. Taken directly from the Matrix dataset
landfill Named - Assigned in cases where EPA did not identify the site as a landfill, but the facility name includes the word ""landfill."" It is possible that these sites have been sufficiently cleaned or were never contaminated to the point of meeting the PCSC designation; thus, they are distinguished from EPA designated landfill sites
PCSC - When no specific designation is provided in the Matrix dataset, ""brownfield"" sites were assigned to a generalized PCSC (Previous, current or suspected contamination) facility type landfill Named - This site type was assigned in cases where EPA did not identify the site as a landfill, but the facility name includes the word ""landfill."" It is possible that these sites have been sufficiently cleaned or were never contaminated to the point of meeting the PCSC designation; they are thus distinguished from EPA designated landfill sites",,,
p_agrivolt,string,"Agrivoltaic facilities make use of the land between panel rows and surrounding arrays for agricultural uses (i.e., crop production or grazing) and/or ecosystem services (e.g., pollinator habitat). Agrivoltaic sites are categorized into the following designations: Crop, Crop_ES, ES, Grazing, Grazing_ES, Non-Agrivoltaic. See https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map",,,
p_zscore,number (float),The z-score of the ratio of facility capacity (in DC) and facility area (p_cap_dc/p_area). A z-score measures how far a record is from the mean of all records in the field in units of standard deviations. Records with high or low Z-scores may have an error in either p_cap_dc or p_area,-1.58467,24.0923,

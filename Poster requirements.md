Poster requirements:

- organize with columns and headings
- 50 - 75 words per text block (section)
- good text sizes and color schemes (Arial No.3/4 for headings, Times New Roman No.5/6 for main body, Arial No.4/5 for graphs)
- logical typography
- extra degree (GIFs or moving pictures) will be better
- content should include Purpose, Observations, Results, Methods, Reference and so on
- For video, not redundant, avoid using jargon
